# Bridgit-s-projects
I am a Public Health Officer and Health Data Analyst skilled in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting health data using SPSS, Python, Excel, SQL, and Power BI. I also build simple AI and ML tools for hospitals, such as disease-prediction and patient-risk systems. My focus is using data and technology to improve healthcare delivery.
